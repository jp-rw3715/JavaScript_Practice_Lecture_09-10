Template literals (backtick strings) let you easily embed variable values into a string using ${variable}.

<!--  -->

Use the if statement to run some code only if a condition is true.

If price is less than budget, the message will print.

<!--  -->

If the condition is true, do something. Otherwise, do something else.

This handles both possible outcomes.

<!--  -->

Use this to select one out of many possible code blocks.

Helps with multiple, step-by-step checks for different alternatives.

<!--  -->

For clearer handling of many fixed options, use switch.

switch checks each case; if none match, runs the default block.

<!--  -->

A shortcut for small if...else checks is the ternary operator:
condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse

Use for simple assignments or message selections.

Statements can be nested inside one another:

This allows for more specific branching inside another condition.

Key Points
JavaScript statements direct how a program runs: variable declarations, assignments, conditionals, and switch cases control the flow.

Prefer let and const to declare variables.

Use if, else if, else, and switch for branching logic.

switch is best for many fixed choices.

Use nested and ternary statements for compact or layered logic.
